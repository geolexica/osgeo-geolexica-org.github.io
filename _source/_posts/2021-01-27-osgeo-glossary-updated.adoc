A new release to celebrate the new year:
the https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Lexicon_Committee[OSGeo Lexicon Committee]
has released its first set of terms!

The OSGeo Glossary comprises new and updated terms with definitions
and examples that are all ready to use.  We have consolidated all
these terms from OSGeo projects and especially the OSGeo Geo4All
newsletter.

Our team worked efficiently through the entire process of compiling,
editing, and collating the terms into a single collection and then
inserting them into Geolexica (the display framework where the terms
were published).
