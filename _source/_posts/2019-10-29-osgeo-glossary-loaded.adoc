The OSGeo Glossary is now managed by the
https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Lexicon_Committee[OSGeo Lexicon Committee],
which is being established.

From today you will notice that the glossary is filled with terms,
compiled courtesy of Cameron Shorter and Felicity Brand. These
terms are not yet stable -- the term IDs may still change during
the testing period.

A special thank you to Reese Plews, convenor of ISO/TC 211's TMG
for reviewing the terms, and Ronald Tse for facilitating the
display of these terms.

Stay tuned, and in the meantime, please feel free to send us
any feedback on the OSGeo mailing list!
